# Self Driving Car (Unfinished)
A self-driving model car running reinforcement learning algorithms implemented in PyTorch.



## 1. Result

### 1.1 Training track:

### 1.2 Test track:

## 2. Setup

### 2.1. Hardware:


##### 2.1.1 Raspberry Pi 3:
It will be running `client_run.py` for gathering data and performing action.
Do not need much computing power.
This is the reason why I choose a Raspberry Pi.

##### 2.1.2 PC:
It will be running `server_run.py`.
Deep Reinforcement learning algorithm needs a lot of computing power.
I run it on a gaming laptop with GTX 980m. It performs quite well.

### 2.2. Software:
Depending on what you intend to do, different package are needed.
See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for more detail.
To make the whole system work 
`numpy`, `zmq`, `blosc`, `pigpio` and `picamera` should be installed on Raspberry Pi.
`numpy`, `zmq`, `blosc`, `pygame` , `gym` and `torch`(PyTorch) should be installed on PC.

## 3. Run

### 3.1 Gather training data

### 3.2 Train in virtual environment

### 3.3 Train in real world

## 4. Next stage

Jetson TX2 on a 1:10 RC Model car.

Maybe drift? Stay tuned!
